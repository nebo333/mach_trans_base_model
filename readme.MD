** This script was for, and supplemented by, Udacity, as part of the Nanodegree in
Adv NLP, and related to the second project **

## Project details

This projet is a series of models, leveraging prior vectorizing and padding scritps
required to be created. The final model is my own creation using a GRU 
model with birectional flows, embedding and various hyperparameters after iterating
on those which provided the best performance

Performance was consistent to within 1-2% on the final model when rerun multiple times
although the predicted sentences at the end were not always perfect.
